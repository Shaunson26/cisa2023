      Dr Isabel Sanmartín is a senior scientist at the Real Jardín Botánico de Madrid (Consejo Superior de
      Investigaciones
      Científicas), where she is also vicedirector of scientific culture. Dr Sanmartín’s research focuses on studying
      the
      evolutionary and ecological processes behind general patterns of biodiversity distribution, with special focus on
      endemism, rarity and geographic disjunctions. She uses model-based approaches, such as Bayesian Inference, to
      integrate multiple sources of evidence, from phylogenetic and genomic data, to geographic databases, the fossil
      record, and paleoclimatic reconstructions. Her latest projects focus on understanding the role of climatic
      extinction
      at deep-time and microevolutionary time scales, and their effect at community levels, such as the observed pattern
      of
      species depauperation in African lineages compared to their Neotropical counterpart. She is currently exploring
      the
      use of machine learning (deep neural) approaches to recover patterns of biotic assembly at different phylogenetic
      levels, from extinction and adaptation.
