      Dr Michelle Leger is a postdoctoral researcher at the Institut de Biologia Evolutiva (CSIC-UPF), Barcelona,
      currently
      holding a Juan de la Cierva Incorporaci√≥n grant. Her research interests are related to protists and the origin and
      evolution of eukaryotes, addressing one of the most important evolutionary transitions in the history of life: the
      origins of multicellularity. She has devoted her career to reconstruct the nature of the unicellular ancestor that
      gave rise to animals by performing comparative and functional genomic analyses between animals and their closest
      unicellular relatives. Dr Leger is also interested in providing a timing in the events in the evolution of
      eukaryotic
      cells using transcriptomics, genomics and proteomics. She has also worked on the function that
      Mitochondrion-related
      organelles (organelles that have independently evolved from mitochondria) play in eukaryotes that live in
      low-oxygen
      conditions.
