      Dr Rosa Fernández is a Ramón y Cajal researcher at the Institute of Evolutionary Biology (CSIC-UPF) in Barcelona,
      where she leads the Metazoa Phylogenomics Lab. Her research focuses on understanding how marine animals reshaped
      their genomes to give rise to animal terrestrial biodiversity. With a passion for unraveling the mysteries of how
      animals transitioned from aquatic to terrestrial environments, Dr. Fernández employs cutting-edge genomics and
      transcriptomics techniques to unlock the genetic secrets behind this remarkable evolutionary transition. Dr
      Fernández is also interested in reconstructing the Animal Tree of Life through phylogenomics approaches.
