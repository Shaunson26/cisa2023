      Dr Joana Xavier is Assistant Researcher and leader of the Deep-Sea Biodiversity and Conservation Team at CIIMAR,
      University of Porto (Portugal), and an invited Associate Professor II in Deep-Sea Biology at the Department of
      Biological Sciences of the University of Bergen (Norway). Her research focuses on the understanding of basin-scale
      diversity, biogeographic, and connectivity patterns of deep-sea sponges and the habitats they form (sponge
      grounds),
      using a combination of disciplines (taxonomy/systematics, ecology and genetics). She also strives to advance the
      science-policy-society interface, developing tools and transferring knowledge to support the implementation of
      international agreements and instruments established to ensure sustainable management and conservation of deep-sea
      vulnerable marine ecosystems. Other areas of interest include biotechnological and biomedical applicability of
      sponges
      (e.g. cellular metabolites and extracellular biomaterials) and their associated microbial communities. Over the
      years,
      she has trained and mentored over 20 students from BSc to PhD levels in the fields of sponge taxonomy,
      systematics,
      phylogenetics, and population genomics. She co-coordinated the H2020 SponGES project, and coordinates the
      DEEPbaseline
      project, an awardee of the Ocean Conservation Fund.
